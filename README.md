## About The Project
(Insert Gif/Picture of project)

In this project we dive into the world of genetic algorithms and investigate whether crafting adversarial examples using these nature-inspired techniques can yield better results than other attacks or not. We will specifically use MNIST to investigate the superiority of genetic algorithms over current methods in the field of low dimensional image data.
